RELEASE HISTORY OF THE "readBrukerFlexData" PACKAGE
===================================================

Version 1.8.5 [2017-04-22]:
- Don't errorously convert tof to mass if "V1.0CTOF2CalibrationConstants" was
  used and throw a warning.

Version 1.8.4 [2016-11-29]:
- Add plain text instrument type in metaData.

Version 1.8.3 [2016-11-29]:
- Fix broken link to IEEE 754 standard in double2singlePrecision manual page.
- Some acqu files report a greater number of tof/mass values than the number of
  intensity values in the fid files. Now the last tof/mass values are removed to
  keep the number of tof/mass/intensity equal and a warning is thrown.
  Thanks to Frederic Foucault <frederic.foucault@mabritec.com> for reporting
  this problem.

Version 1.8.2 [2014-12-15]:
- Fix sampleName for directory structures generated by old versions of the
  Bruker FlexControl software.
  Thanks to Christoph Lange <christoph@clange.de> for reporting this problem.

Version 1.8.1 [2014-11-04]:
- Fix: Reading a file that has no values for "HPClUse" or "Lift1"/"Lift2"
  failed.
  Thanks to Christoph Lange <christoph@clange.de> for reporting this problem.

Version 1.8 [2014-09-26]:
- mqReadBrukerFlex is removed. Use MALDIquantForeign::importBrukerFlex instead.

Version 1.7 [2013-08-10]:
- Always return intensity values as "double".
- Now all negative intensity values are replaced by zero.
  This could be disabled by setting the new argument
  "keepNegativeIntensities" to "TRUE" [not recommended].
- Replace all paste(..., sep="") by paste0;
  now readBrukerFlexData depends on R >= 2.15.

Version 1.6.3 [2013-04-28]:
- Fetch spectrum position from IMS data files.

Version 1.6.2 [2013-03-28]:
- Fix: empty digityzerType, spectrumType, acquisitionMode throw an error.

- metaData: update digityzerType, spectrumType, acquisitionMode.
- Remove LICENSE file.

Version 1.6 [2012-12-08]:
- mqReadBrukerFlex is marked as deprecated. Use
  MALDIquantForeign::importBrukerFlex instead.
- Fix description.

Version 1.5 [2012-10-19]:
- readBrukerFlexFile doesn't store original mass in metaData$backup anymore if
  HPC was detected (to get original mass set argument "useHpc" to FALSE).

Version 1.4 [2012-09-10]:
- Update DESCRIPTION file to use Authors@R and depends on R>=2.14 now.
- Add warning if LIFT mode was used.
- Split into multiple files.
- Roxygenize package.

Version 1.3 [2012-05-06]:
- mqReadBrukerFlex always returns a list of MassSpectrum objects
  (for a single MassSpectrum object it returns a list, too).

Version 1.2.7 [2012-03-09]:
- Keep filename if removeMetaData==TRUE.

Version 1.2.6 [2012-03-08]:
- Accept comma as decimal mark for timeDelta.

Version 1.2.5 [2012-03-07]:
- Fix directory separator handling for sampleName on windows.

Version 1.2.4 [2012-02-02]:
- Accept comma as decimal mark in acqu files.
- Replace some warning()'s by stop()'s.

Version 1.2.3 [2012-01-29]:
- Fetch endianness of fid file from acqu file.
- Change NAMESPACE.
- Hide .hpc by NAMESPACE.

Version 1.2.2 [2012-01-18]:
- Fix warning message "empty spectrum".

Version 1.2.1 [2011-12-19]:
- Set default value filterZeroIntensities=FALSE.

Version 1.2 [2011-12-19]:

- Fix bug which produced NaN's if ML3==0
  (reported and patched by Julien Textoris).

Version 1.1 [2011-05-28]:
- Add mqReadBrukerFlex.
- Depends on R>=2.10.

Version 1.0.5 [2011-03-21]:
- Surround package names by double quotes.

Version 1.0.4 [2011-02-19]:
- Replace library reference in cpSpecHpcMzXml-data to readMzXmlData.
- Replace all paste(directory, file, sep="/") by file.path(directory, file).

Version 1.0.3 [2011-02-16]:
- Fix directory separator in an example.

Version 1.0.2 [2011-02-16]:
